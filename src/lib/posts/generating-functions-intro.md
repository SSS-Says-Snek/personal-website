I have loved and been interested in math for a very long time by now. However, even though it may be just be my inexperience with other fields, I have found generating functions
to be one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking topics I have yet learned. So what are these curious mathematical objects, and how can we solve problems with them?

## Basic Definition

The most intuitive definition of generating functions I've heard is from Herbert Wilf's *generatingfunctionology*

<Quote text="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."/>

You see, when sigmas unite
